# shopping-online-microservices
I've created those services in order to show you how implement a micro-service architecture, just a small services with CRUD operations :

The following are list of our services :
<ul>
<li>
  <b>Product Service :</b> Allow us to create and view products.
</li>
<li>
  <b> Order Service : </b>Allow us to order products.
</li>
<li>
  <b> Inventory Service :</b> Check if a product is in stock or not.
</li>
<li>
  <b> Notification Service :</b> Send a notification after creation of order.
</li>
  
</ul>

Security is configured by Keycloak service and implemented on api-gateway, then all services are protected. 

A picture below shows architecture of micro-services :
